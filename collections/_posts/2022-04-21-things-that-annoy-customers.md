# Things That Annoy Customers When They Visit Your Website

Written by AJ Davis

In today’s times, it does not matter whether you own a digital business or bricks and mortar business. In both cases, it is essential to have a website for your business. Since customers are online, you need to offer products and services to them on a digital platform with the help of an easy-to-use website. However, keep in mind that merely having a website is not enough.

You must make sure your website stands out among your competitors’ websites online. If you do not know whether your website is being liked by your customers or not, you can hire a company to do a <a href="https://experimentzone.com/services/user-research-analytics/">remote user research for your website</a>. With the help of this research, you will get to know how customers are interacting with your website.

If customers are not liking your website, you need to know what it is that they are disliking. In this blog, we will tell you some common aspects of websites that customers usually dislike or find it difficult to deal with. What are those aspects? Let’s find out.


## Slow Loading Times

Every company is trying its best to improve website user experience of their customers. Because of this competition among businesses to impress their customers, customers now have become used to high standards when it comes to using websites. If your website is even a tad bit slow, customers will become impatient and switch to another website that sells the same service or product as you do. That is why it is essential for you to make sure that you website runs smoothly and loads quickly.


## No Value For Visitors

It is understandable that companies would want to talk about themselves, their achievements, and their uniqueness on their own websites. However, you should not forget that your website will become popular among your customers only if it provides value to them. Although your website is about your business, keep in mind it should cater the needs of your customers in every aspect. You must give reasons to your customers to visit your website and buy products or services from it.  Although it depends on your business type what kind of content you offer to your customers, it is generally good to include blogs, videos, tutorials, etc., on your website to build credibility and to help your customers get value out of their visit.


## Lack of Information 

One of the worst mistakes in a business website is lack of information or minimal information. While design is important, you can still compromise it for key information. When people visit your website, they have many questions pertaining to your brand, your products, terms and conditions, and whatnot. It is essential for you to make sure that your website has everything a visitor wants to know. For instance ‘about us’ page and ‘FAQ’ section are a must for every website.

Other mistakes in a website include excessive pop-ups, autoplay videos, lack of contact details, generic photographs, and other similar things. While all the above-mentioned aspects are some of the most common mistakes in websites, it is essential for you to understand that each website has its own unique problems and requirements.
