# Leveraging A/B Testing as an Optimization Strategy Technique to Improve Conversions

Written by AJ Davis

Among the most significant challenges in front of businesses is keeping up with the conversion on their business websites. While there are endless techniques available on the Internet, A/B testing can be a reliable <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://experimentzone.com/blog/ab-testing-tools/">optimization strategy technique</a> to reverse the dropping conversions and bring back your revenue patterns. 

## What is A/B testing?

A/B testing is a technique used to compare the effectiveness of various types of content, overlays, notifications, and more according to predefined goals and find out the elements performing better in sync with those goals. The technique is also called split testing and can be used to test multiple variations of the same element.

While there may be many different testing tools available on the market, it is crucial to choose tools based on the specific needs and goals of your website. For instance, the same tools that are used for insights may not be suitable for evaluating test ideas and running tests. Read more about choosing the best A/B testing tools for your organization <a href="https://experimentzone.com/blog/ab-testing-tools/">here</a>.

## How A/B testing works

As discussed above, A/B testing is a comparison technique that helps find the most effective variation for an element. But what does that mean? Let’s understand this with the help of an example.

Suppose your eCommerce website has a yellow Shop CTA. If you want to run A/B testing for this CTA, the yellow button may be considered as the ‘A’ variation, and another blue shop CTA can be taken at the ‘B’ variation of the same element. The idea here is to find out which color works the best. 

Now is the time to make changes and note the differences in the conversion rates. The key to success is to make one change for every variation. Don’t make the common mistake of adjusting the font size, button color, and font style all at once, as it may leave you confused about which change led to an improvement or reduction in the conversion rate. Also, make sure to keep the audience similar in terms of size and demographic to avoid inaccuracy in results.

## Preferred elements for A/B testing 

To perform A/B testing, you can test headlines and body copy in terms of the tone, information source, copy structure, and more. You can also test CTAs, email subject lines, images and videos, product descriptions, etc.

## The bottom line

A sudden unexpected drop in conversion rate may disrupt your business and profits, but there’s a solution to mitigating these risks. You can always find a technique that helps repair the damage. And in case you cannot, you can reach out to experience optimization experts to help you out by pinpointing problematic areas and offering solutions.
