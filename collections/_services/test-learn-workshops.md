Help your team uncover and focus on the biggest problems for your customers. We guide teams through formative activities to align goals and reveal the best ideas.

Customized workshops available upon request.

## GEM Workshops

This 4-hour workshop will take your team through (1) Generating ideas, (2) Evaluating ideas, and (3) planning how to Measure those ideas. Your team will walk away with a testing roadmap that is data-driven and user-centric.

This is for you if:

- You want your whole team to be involved in the testing program.
- You want to quickly align on where to start testing.

This is NOT for you if:

- Decisions are made from the top down at your company (and you don’t want that to change).

## Design Sprint

This 5-day series is based on the Google Sprint model. This in-depth workshop will help your team uncover what problem you’re solving and potential solutions.

This for you if:

- You want to add a new product or product feature
- You want to align across different teams across your company

## Measure Ideas

We’ll put those ideas to the test – literally! We’ll run A/B tests on the top scoring test ideas to validate that they help with <a class="glossary-word" href="https://experimentzone.com/support/glossary/#Conversion">conversion</a> – and quantify how much they help.
